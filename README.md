# Distributed Coverage Control

This repo contains the code for my final year thesis.

## TODO 
* Separate compute_voronoi, draw_voronoi into 1 module
* Only scale variables (meters -> pixels) when rendering, not when computing

## Requirements
This work is developed in Python 3.10, with libraries specified in `requirements.txt`. To install, just run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to run
Edit the `CONTROLLER` in the `configs.py` file and run `python3 main.py`.
