# Coverage Control For Mobile Sensing Networks
This is the implementation for the paper: [Coverage control for mobile sensing networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0212212). The density function can be modified to achieve the results in the original research.

## Notes

* When computing integral using mesh grid method, try to convert from pixels to meters
